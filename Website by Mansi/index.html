          <div class="ab-s main-ab-s" data-sr>1996 born, I have immense passion for coding and management. I completed my high school from DAV Centenary Public School, Delhi and currently pursuing "Bachelors in Technology" in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Delhi Technological University. I am a quick learner and love to develop.</div>
          <div class="ab-s" data-sr>Back in 11th grade, my computer teacher asked me to prepare for a coding competition. And that is when it all began for me. I had this desperation to learn and get better at it, and that has been in me since forever. From experimenting website codes to developing my own logics, I eventually joined Coding Ninjas and learned competitive coding over there. </div>
          <div class="ab-s" data-sr>Apart from the knack for coding, I also have an interest in management, which I have exploited too, in my school by being the Vice-Head Girl or in the college, by being the President of the Dramatics Society. I have worked on <b>Photoshop, HTML, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, MySQL, C++, C, Java.</b> I love to learn new languages and frameworks, and to manage situations, lead a team, provide a vision to a community; these are the things which my skillset allows. I am currently working to get better at programming and would want to take up my career in it. </div>
